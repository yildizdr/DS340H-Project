Investigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and other factors on the amount of time people in the U.S. spend outside of their home using the BLS's American Time Use Survey (ATUS) dataset. 

**Research Questions:**
1. To what extent has the amount of time adults and children in the U.S. spend outside of their home returned to pre-March 13th 2020 levels in 2023? 
2. What factors are related to the amount of time a person spends outside of their home? 

Note: “Outside” means outside of the person’s own home or yard.
